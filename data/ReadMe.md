The data used in this study is from Hubble's paper "A relation between distance and radial velocity among extra-galactic nebulae", PNAS March 15, 1929 15 (3) 168-173.
We first tabulated the data in an excel file named Hubble.xlsx. 
We then created a csv file containing only the information on the distances and velocities of the galaxies. The file is named Hubble2.csv.
